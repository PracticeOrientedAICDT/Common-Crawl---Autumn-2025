####  Founded in 1973, Carlisle Refrigeration quickly established itself as a leading name in the commercial and industrial refrigeration sales and service business.
Carlisle Refrigeration (trading as Thermo King Northern) has represented Thermo King as a main sales and service dealer for nearly forty years. It is this partnership and experience which has helped us to provide world class service to our customers.
Over the years we have seen massive growth in the refrigeration industry brought about by the rise of supermarkets, technical innovation, strict legislation and the desire for a more comfortable environment. With these trends our business has grown, increasing our customer base and ability to supply the answers to all your refrigeration or air conditioning needs.
We pride ourselves on our expertise, delivery of prompt and effective service – backed up by 50 mobile engineers on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
