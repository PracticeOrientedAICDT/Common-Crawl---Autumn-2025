With lots of hard work and timely communication they made sure they delivered the best to me. Highly recommended!\n### Rhona Rowland\nVSH Law\n“Simon has been my broker for over a decade. He is a pleasure to deal with. His passion is to get the best premium and policy to suit your business and will go the extra mile to achieve this. Most of all he cares and I can categorically say in distressed commercial times Simon has saved the day. I can highly recommend him.”\n### Helen Pittard\nHLP Legal Ltd t/a 174 Family Law\n“I can’t speak highly enough about Gillian Anderson and the invaluable support she has provided to our business. I first met Gillian when I was considering starting my solicitors practice as I was looking for guidance about obtaining professional indemnity insurance. Gillian spent the time to get to know my plans and advised on the practical points I needed to consider. Her extensive knowledge and practical knowhow were instrumental in securing an excellent insurance policy in a difficult insurance market.\n### Paul Clark\nSpall Clark Solicitors\n“As a firm we’d got into the habit of renewing our PI with the same broker, as it felt that was the easiest option, but from the first conversation with Gillian at Quality PI I knew that it was time to change. Gillian and Phil are very personable and have gone out of their way to ensure that we are fully equipped with all the information we need and are on hand for any queries, large or small”\n### Jo May\nDF Legal LLP\n“We are pleased to recommend Claire Wills of QPI who has been immensely professional, empathetic and helpful to us over the last 10 or more years we have worked with her. She has taken time to understand our business model and has supported us for many years in obtaining competitive quotes for us in all our dealing with her. We have every confidence in her service and she has demonstrated exceptional commitment and knowledge of the industry”\n### Adjoa Djan-Krofa\nPishon Gold Solicitors\n“Claire Wills is by far the best PII broker I have come across and we have been working together since I opened my firm in 2016. She is personable and efficient and extremely proactive not just in hunting down, but also in negotiating, the best possible deal on the market. Claire is even able to pull miracles out of a hat at the last minute when one is late with one’s paperwork: definitely the go-to person for anyone looking for a good deal and a bespoke and thoughtful service”.\n### Catherine Silwal\nTeelan & Silwal Family Law Ltd\n“I have worked with Gillian for about 10 years. She has looked after the professional indemnity insurance for my business. She has also helped numerous new start-ups that I have recommended her to. She is friendly and approachable but also highly efficient and approachable. Her and her colleagues will always be my first choice when it come to insurance.”\n### Steve Cornforth\nSteve Cornforth Consultancy\n“There is only 1 person that I trust when it comes to our PII renewal, Claire is an absolute gem and genuinely cares for her clients she is always on the end of the phone and is always happy to assist. She goes above and beyond other brokers we have dealt with over the years, and I recommend their services to everyone I know. A customer care focused driven broker who never fails to get me the best quote for renewal”\n### Maya Nisa-Zaman\nMZ Law Solicitors Ltd\n“I have used Simon Ong and QPI’s services for a number of years. During this time, I have never had an issue with their service and find Simon, Phil and the team to be consummate approachable professionals, with a wealth of knowledge in the insurance and risk mitigation field.

I’m Natasha and I am the owner of Monkey Puzzle Astwick. My passion, which runs throughout our nursery, is to give children access to the environment so that every child has the chance to learn through outside adventures, as every child deserves the chance to fly a kite or jump in a stream. [My team](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/meet-the-team/) and I are dedicated to giving every child the best start in life by caring for and supporting them to play, learn and grow in a positive and [stimulating environment](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/environment/).\nI would love to welcome and show you around our beautiful nursery setting so please get in touch.\nNatasha\n**Nursery Owner**\n## Enjoy our virtual tour\n## What Makes Us Special\n## Award-Winning Care\nWe’re proud to be recognised among the Top 20 Day Nurseries in the region, a reflection of our team’s passion and dedication. With glowing 5-star reviews from parents, we deliver exceptional care and education every day. Our staff go above and beyond to create a nurturing environment where every child feels seen, heard, and loved. We celebrate each child’s individuality, guiding them through their early years with warmth and expertise. Our strong relationships with families and children are what make our nursery truly special.\n[Find Out More](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/care/)\n## Forest School Magic\nOur Forest School sessions bring learning to life through the wonder of nature. Set in the countryside, children enjoy outdoor adventures like climbing trees, making mud pies, and cooking over campfires. These hands-on experiences help build independence, resilience, and teamwork from an early age. Led by our qualified Forest School Leader, sessions are child-led and rooted in curiosity and creativity. We believe that learning doesn’t have to happen inside four walls. Nature offers endless opportunities to grow, explore, and have fun every day.\n[Find Out More](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/forest-school/)\n## Home-from-Home Environment\nOur nursery is designed to feel like a second home—warm, welcoming, and filled with love. Each room is tailored to the needs of its age group, creating safe and stimulating spaces where children feel truly nurtured. With cosy corners, free-flow gardens, and thoughtfully chosen resources, we support children in building confidence and emotional security. Our team works hard to create a peaceful, consistent environment that feels familiar and comforting. Children are supported at every stage, developing independence and strong foundations for life.\n[Find Out More](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/environment/)\n## Fantastic Outdoor Space\nAt Monkey Puzzle Astwick, children thrive in a stunning countryside setting with daily access to nature, animals, and fresh air. Our converted barn nursery offers open space and freedom for little explorers to learn through adventure. Whether it’s picking fruit, building dens, or saying hello to farm animals, the outdoors is at the heart of what we do. We believe real-life experiences help children grow into curious, confident learners. Our passionate team encourages outdoor discovery in all weather, sparking joy and imagination every single day.\n[Find Out More](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/curriculum/)\n## Social Development\nChildcare offers more than financial benefits. It’s a gateway for children to build relationships, develop social skills, make friends, and enjoy diverse learning experiences. This prepares them not just for school but also for life. We are part of the local community groups, building relationships with other local businesses, schools and baby groups.\n## High-Quality Early Education\nAccess to funded childcare ensures children benefit from professional early years educators. Nurseries like Monkey Puzzle focus on creating enriching environments where children can play, learn, and grow. Combined with the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework, this ensures children are set up for a confident start to their education journeys.\n## Enhanced Work-Life Balance\nMore affordable childcare means parents can take on more working hours or even return to work. This creates opportunities for career growth free from the worry of excessive childcare costs.\n## Reduced Nursery Fees\nFor working parents, nursery fees often represent a significant part of household expenses. That’s why we are committed to providing a nurturing, home-like environment where your children reach milestones with care and support.\nWith 30 hours funded childcare, families can save an average of £7,500 per year per child. This allows parents to re-prioritise other important aspects of their lives, such as savings or home improvements.\n## Parent and Carer Reviews\nFrom our Daynurseries.co.uk reviews, find out what our parents have to say about their time at our Monkey Puzzle Day Nursery and Preschool in Astwick.\nHear what our parents and carers have to say about our Monkey Puzzle Day Nursery and Preschool in Astwick with a selection of reviews from Daynurseries.co.uk.\n## A Day In Our Nursery\n## Healthy Eating\nAs children grow, a healthy and balanced diet is key, and we inspire with a variety of colour, texture, and taste to expand their food experiences.\nSeasonal and local produce are also important in helping children understand more about where food comes from and nutrition.\n[Explore Example Menu](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/nutrition/)\n## All The Essentials\nMonkey Puzzle Astwick key information at a glance.\n* __\nLearning guided by the national Early Years Foundation Stage\n*  __\nAn amazing home-from-home environment\n*  __\nDaily extracurricular activities, all included in our fees\n* __\nBranded nappies and creams included\n*  __\nFantastic all-seasons outdoor play area\n*  __\nInspiring, caring and highly qualified team\n*  __\nOpen 51 weeks of the year\n## Exciting Days\nIt’s smiles all round with fun and inspiring days with child centred activities supported, guided, and encouraged by our passionate team.\nFollow your child’s progress as they learn and develop through their learning journal with regular updates from our nursery team throughout their day with us.\n[Explore Example Timetable](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/environment/)\n[](https://monkeypuzzleastwick.co.uk/enquire-now/)\n## Enquire now for a personal tour of our nursery\n____\n## Meet A Few Of Our Team\nOur amazing, highly qualified and creative nursery team support and care for your little learner as they play, develop and grow.\n* ## Abi\n###\n* ## Zoe\n###\n* ## Sandra\n###\n## What’s Been Happening At Our Nursery\nComments Box SVG iconsUsed for the like, share, comment, and reaction icons\n[ Monkey Puzzle Day Nursery Astwick  2 weeks ago  ](https://facebook.com/781907285525227)\nAstwick Pumpkin Patch 🎃\nHuge well done to our wonderful families on their Pumpkins this year and helping to create our mini pumpkin patch!  ...

Our website works best with JavaScript enabled: [Learn how to enable JavaScript](http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=23852)\n### Local, reliable and friendly\nCroft Buildings Solutions is managed by a small team who collectively have around 50 years’ experience in the construction industry, delivering a huge range of construction projects across a large sector of end-users predominately in the Lincolnshire/Yorkshire/East Midlands and Nottinghamshire regions.\nWith works varying from a 2-hour repair to a townhouse, to a 2-year project building a 20 storey luxury apartment block complete with the renovation of a listed monument partially founded in a river in a city centre location.\nUsing this all-encompassing exposure to virtually all facets of this country’s largest employment sector Croft Building Solutions was found, to deliver building projects ranging from £200 – £200,000 in our core location. Our work is all about “improving a building’s performance”.\n[Explore some of our work](http://croftbuildings-co-uk.stackstaging.com/client-feedback/case-studies/)\n#### Why we do, what we do\n* * *\nCreating, altering, repairing or maintaining a building can have a huge positive impact on people’s lives, be that a place to live, work, play, learn, or get better.\nWhen it is done well it can be a very rewarding experience for everybody involved. Unfortunately in our experience, employing Builders is not always all that it should be. In fact, the thought of engaging with a Builder fills some people dread. This can be for all sorts of reasons, such as previous bad experience, consumer journalism, a cautionary tale from a friend, or just a very fertile imagination. Sometimes however this feeling of woe relates to the Builders inability to rightly gain the confidence of a potential customer; be that because of a lack of understanding of client requirements, not being forthcoming with the right solutions, or just not going that extra mile to deliver great service.\nThis is what Croft Building Solutions aims to put right.\n[Speak to our friendly team today __](http://croftbuildings-co-uk.stackstaging.com/contact/)\n####\n### Our promise to you\n* * *\nIt’s not rocket science, but we have jointly spent 50 years thinking about what a great building service would look like that would repeatedly delight its clients time after time. Below is our approach which seems to work very well according to our customers:\n### Listen first\nCroft spend plenty of time listening to how our customers currently use their building, what it could do better; if they have a long term plan for their building be that a home, a place to work… etc. etc.; how could their building impact more positively on their families, work colleagues or clients; what outcomes would you hope to experience; what good value would look like to you (often called value engineering). When we think we fully understand our clients’ needs and hopes we confirm them back just to make sure. In our view this is the most important part of our process.\n### Sustainable delivery\nThe way we deliver the mutually agreed outcomes, is done in a way that it is enduring. By this we mean that we have to take a very responsible view and carry out actions accordingly; such as Money (yours and ours); Safety & Health; Environment; Quality, Longevity & Fitness for purpose; Neighbours; Statute and other agreed parameters. If you work in the sector you will be familiar with CDM, RAMS, KPI’s, ERIC & SHEQ, SSW & SOPs, we view these concepts as a fundamental part of sustainable delivery; if you don’t work in the sector you will be pleased that we take our responsibility for everybody’s wellbeing relating to a building project as paramount, now and in the future.\n### Offer value solutions\nOnce we fully understand every aspect of the proposed project we aim to offer where appropriate various knowledge based solutions and we clearly point out the strengths and weakness of each across a multitude of criteria such as speed of construction, longevity, certainty of cost, impact on building users during construction, safety, environmental considerations, and any other criteria our client thinks relevant. Another aspect of the value we offer is the reassurance and comfort that we will do what we say, and this is best exemplified by our professional and corporate membership of the international Chartered Institute of Building.\n### Build relationships\nWe build our future on our past, so delighting our clients is at the top of our priority list. To check that we are achieving this we get feedback through various methods, the customer questionnaire is one of our favourites, and we then tweak our systems if necessary. We are consistently rated as very good across all the criteria’s we check against.\n### Really impressed and would recommend\n__\nI had to have some work carried out to my roof and rainwater pipes. The men from Croft came when they said they would were really polite, told what was going on, and after 3 days all the work was done well, the garden was left clean and tidy, and they even asked me to check everything was OK before they left. I am really impressed and have told my daughter about them, who is going to be having some building work done.\n**Jean**\n## Why Choose Croft Building Solutions\nQuality\nSafety\nExperience\nInnovation\nSkilled\nVision\nIntegrity\n[more reasons to use us ](/why-choose-us)\n© 2025 Croft Building Solutions Ltd ∼ Company No. 06962211 ∼ Registered in the UK\n[Terms of Service](https://croftbuildings.co.uk/terms-of-service-agreement/) ∼ [Privacy Notice](https://croftbuildings.co.uk/privacy-notice/) ∼ [Cookie Notice](https://croftbuildings.co.uk/cookie-notice/) ∼ [Report A Bug](mailto:s%75%70p%6frt%40l%61s%65r.re%64?subject=Croft Building Solutions: Bug Report)\n[Web Development by Laser Red in Lincolnshire](https://laser.red/?utm_source=croftbuildings.co.uk&utm_medium=Laser+Red+logo&utm_content=Website&utm_campaign=Client+Website \"Website by Laser Red\")"

        "markdown_content": "# A family-run company committed to its customer\nSolid Surfacing Company is a family-run business, owned and operated by the Reid family: Bill, Jill, Rachel and John. We are based in Kidderminster and have been in the industry since 1994.\nOur family company manufactures bespoke, high-quality products for both residential homes and large commercial clients across the UK. Bill and John in particular have had a lifetime’s worth of experience in the surface production industry. As the largest solid surfacing manufacturer in the Midlands, we have an unrivalled knowledge, which enables us to offer each customer the highest possible standard of service, from the manufacture to the supply of all types of work surface.\nSince our company’s foundation, we have aimed to provide bespoke, specialist counters and washrooms on a nationwide basis. We strive to produce only the highest quality work and provide only the best in customer service – to both residential homeowners and commercial property owners alike.\n## Our story\nThe journey began with Bill, who has been working in the industry since 1987. Bill has since grown the company into what it is today. With hard work, perseverance and help from those around him, he created a strong, reliable company, whilst truly preserving the family-run nature of the business. In 2007, John (now Managing Director) joined the business, adding his own experience with large-scale clients to the mix, in addition to managing commercial sales and overall production.\nJohn’s wife Rachel recently joined in June 2022 and works as an administrator, focussing particularly on business development and retail sales.\nAs a true family-operated business, we offer a much more personal service on every project, with our customers forming the heart of our business. Indeed, our company ethos is to ensure both excellent customer service and top-quality products. Solid Surfacing Company has been trading for almost thirty years and has built an outstanding reputation in the commercial and residential surfacing world.\nBill’s wife, Jill, joined in 2012. After a long and successful career in law, she now applies her expertise by handling all the company’s contracts and administrative affairs, including employment law and H&S.\nTheir daughter, Alexandra, also joined the family business in 2010. She now, acts as marketing consultant to guarantee the success of Solid Surfacing Company. Meanwhile, their nephew, Andrew, is the Production Manager who is responsible for ensuring that jobs run like clockwork from the moment the order is placed, through the factory process, and on to delivery and installation.\nFrom initial enquiry through to completion, our experience and commitment ensure that your contract – no matter how big or small – is handled professionally. We always endeavour to complete our work as cost-effectively as possible, working to your budget, your brief and your deadlines throughout each stage of the project.\n## Introducing our showroom\nIn 2019, we opened a stunning new showroom in Kidderminster. Fully furnished with our own unique creations, it’s the perfect place to discover what we can do. Whether you want to visit to speak to our designers, take a look at our examples or request samples to help you choose the right solid surface, we highly recommend a visit. You can even watch us manufacture some of our bespoke products to get a better idea of the passion and care we put into our projects.\n## Our enquiry process\nWith almost thirty years of experience in the industry, Solid Surfacing Company offers a bespoke service, allowing us to tailor our products to your individual requirements. We give expert advice, offer free quotes and – once these quotes have been accepted – produce industry-standard CAD drawings and manufacture your order within our factory premises to your exact specifications. All templating, manufacturing and installation is carried out by our experienced joinery and fabrication team.\nFrom the moment you make your initial enquiry, we strive to make you feel completely at ease and aim to cater to your every need.\nWe encourage clients to visit our showroom where possible, as this will allow you to view our extensive range of products, samples and various surfacing options in finer detail. We even invite customers to come to watch the manufacturing processes live. Whether for informative or entertainment purposes, this will be a memorable experience all the same.\n## The team\nSolid Surfacing Company now has over twenty employees and treats each and every one of them like a member of the family. We pride ourselves on working together as a team to achieve the best results in every project that we take on. Our friendly and helpful staff in all departments are more than happy to be of assistance.\n### CAD\nWe have a dedicated CAD team led by Andrew – another member of the family. The team’s extensive design knowledge and experience come together to bring our customers’ drawings to life, guaranteeing that they capture their vision perfectly.\nThey also operate and programme our CNC machinery, which is used for our more technically challenging fabrications. This is in addition to managing the company’s stock. Andrew, Kurt and Dominic form an incredibly capable team whose work is central to our business.\n### Fabrication\nSolid Surfacing Company simply wouldn’t exist without the sheer hard work and dedication of our fabrication team.\nAdam, Chris, Mark, Gareth, Callum, Chris, Nick and trainee Dominic continue to make the company the success story that it is today and constantly strive for innovation and improvement. The team also ensures that our reputation for top-quality work is always upheld on every project we work on.\n## Enquire now\nIf you'd like to know more about how we can help you with your projects, please drop us an email, give us a call or fill out our contact form.\nIf you already have technical drawings/CADs, then you can even drag and drop these to send across to us too. We would love to hear from you!\n## Our happy customers\nShirley Davies\nThank you for the truly amazing way that your company dealt with my disaster. I have no words to describe the horror of looking down at my cracked Corian sink just two weeks ago. The efficiency and speed that was put so promptly into place to help me overcome my catastrophe will always stay in my mind.\nMr & Mrs Mardon\nWe love our new Corian worktops. Thank you for good service, great fit and fabulous people...\nScott Minton\nThank you very much for the work your company did at our club. It was first class and all who have seen it are very impressed.\nRA Wilson\nPlease thank Adam so much for his friendly efficient and immaculate service and also Chris and Josh for their input too. VERY impressive.\nJosephine Walton\nI would like to say how pleased I am with the efficiency of your workmen. Polite and did the job without any mess or trouble.\n[](tel:01562750000)[](mailto:sales@solidsurfacingcompany.co.uk)[](https://www.facebook.com/solidsurfacingco/)[](https://www.instagram.com/solidsurfacing/?hl=en)[](https://twitter.com/SurfacingSolid)\nclosearrow-circle-o-downbarsangle-downellipsis-v"

        "markdown_content": "Skip to content\n# About\nThe Jordon Group\n## Experts in shopfitting & refrigeration  since 1965\nFor over 60 years, The Jordon Group has been a trusted partner in shopfitting, refrigeration, and air conditioning – delivering specialist solutions to businesses across the UK and beyond. What began as a small family business has grown into a nationally recognised name, built on a reputation for quality, reliability, and genuine customer care.\nOur continued success is fuelled by innovation, efficiency, and a hands-on approach to service. From independent retailers to global brands, we tailor every solution to meet our clients’ unique needs – whether it’s a complete commercial fit-out, bespoke refrigeration system, or cutting-edge energy-saving technology.\nWhile we’ve expanded and evolved over the decades, our core values remain the same. Since 1965, we’ve taken pride in delivering expert workmanship, personal service, and lasting results – project after project.\nOur history\n[ Meet the team ](https://jordon.co.uk/meet-the-team/)\n## Our history:\n## Our Roots\nFounded in 1965 by Edward Jordon, E Jordon (Refrigeration) Ltd began life in a former co-op building in Oldham. From the start, the company was built on strong values: craftsmanship, reliability, and a personal approach. By 1971, a key partnership was formed with Italian refrigeration giant Arneg, laying the foundation for long-standing international collaboration. Paul Jordon, Edward’s son, qualified as a refrigeration engineer in 1985 and joined the company full time- marking the next generation of leadership. By 1990, the business had grown to a team of 28, with roles spanning engineering, joinery, sales, and admin.\n## A Family Legacy Grows\nThe 1990s were a time of momentum. Paul Jordon became an associate member of the Institute of Refrigeration and took full control of the business as Managing Director in 1998. Two years later, Edward Jordon was honoured for 35 years of continued growth. In 2001, The Jordon Group name was officially adopted following the acquisition of Rock Refrigeration’s commercialdivision. Continued growth led to a move to larger premises in Manchester, and in 2007, the company relocated again- this time to our current 38,000 sq ft headquarters in Oldham.\n## National Presence & Industry Recognition\nBy 2008, with 42 staff and national operations, The Jordon Group earned the Investors in People accreditation. Major milestones followed, including high-profile projects like Manchester Airport Terminal 2 and securing partnerships with major forecourt and retail operators. By 2012, turnover had hit £11.5 million, enabling investment in vehicles, 3D CAD systems, forklifts, and smart racking. With a growing team and national reputation, the business had doubled its sales and joinery departments by 2010 and crossed £20 million in turnover by 2016, with over 100 employees\n## A Family Legacy Grows\n## Expanding into New Markets\nIn 2017, we expanded into Europe with EG Group and began our long-standing relationship with Center Parcs—being shortlisted as their Supplier of the Year. In 2018, we transitioned toISO9001:2015 Quality Assurance Accreditation, reinforcing our commitment to excellence. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, our team showed resilience and flexibility -continuing to support essential sectors and adapting to new ways of working. Through every challenge, our people-first culture remained central to how we operate.\n## A New Chapter with Bellrock\nIn 2024, The Jordon Group proudly joined the Bellrock Group—an exciting new chapter that combines our family values with national scale. This partnership strengthens our capabilities while keeping the same personal touch that’s been with us since day one. Today, we employ over 140 people, turn over £40 million annually, and continue to deliver fit-out, refrigeration, and HVAC services across the UK. From independent retailers to national brands, we remain dedicated to helping businesses stay efficient, compliant, and future-ready—with quality, care, and integrity at the core of everything we do."

We are designing proprietary novel small molecule therapeutic candidates with the intent of developing best/first in class therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, using our drug discovery and medicinal chemistry expertise and deep understanding of GPCR biology.\nOur registered office is located in Belleville, Ontario and we have talent hubs in Quebec, Canada, and in the United Kingdom.\nLiminal BioSciences is a privately held company owned by Structured Alpha LP (“SALP”), a limited partnership managed by its general partner, Thomvest Asset Management Ltd.\n##  GPCR’s: Compelling Biological Mechanisms\nG proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide binding proteins, act as molecular switches inside cells and are involved in transmitting signals. GPCRs regulate numerous diverse physiological and pathological processes. Due to their abundance, broad distribution, and crucial involvement in cellular physiology and biochemistry, GPCRs represent the largest family of receptors in the human genome and hold significant importance in the development of therapeutics. Around 35% of all approved drugs target GPCRs, yet only around 16% of GPCR pathways have an approved drug, providing us with a significant opportunity for discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics for GPCR pathways.\nAll of our development programs target seven transmembrane GPCRs (7TM GPCR’s), where the receptor protein passes through the cell membrane seven times. These receptors are easily accessible to hydrophilic drugs due to their presence on the cell surface, and their non-uniform expression enables selectivity in modulating physiological processes. Agonists and antagonists of 7TM GPCRs receptors are utilized for treating various diseases in all organ systems. An agonist is a drug that binds to a target and mimics the action of the natural ligand. An antagonist is a drug that binds to a receptor and prevents other molecules (such as the natural ligand) from binding."

We grew purely by way of personal recommendation from clients, architects, and interior designers. Our unusual sensitivity to design and quality set us apart from many of our competitors.\nToday we operate primarily as investors and developers. We believe buildings should enhance the environment in which they sit and create spaces that people enjoy living and working in.\nCareful design and quality materials are key to all our projects. Every project is design-led, we do not do standard house types like many larger developers. Our approach to business is based on integrity and reliability. This has led to many strong and lasting relationships with trusted partners and suppliers across the industry.\n### Testimonials\n## Andrew Pollard, MD, Stack & Bonnor Estate Agents\nThis was a very exciting and complicated development consisting of nine apartments, a large, detached house and commercial space. The units were incredibly well-designed, constructed to an exemplary standard and beautifully finished and were very, very popular with the purchasers. Abimara had several unexpected hurdles to overcome during the build process and these were overcome in an incredibly positive and most professional way. I am looking forward to our next project together and genuinely can’t speak too highly of Dan and his team.\n[ View Projects ](https://abimara.com/projects/)\n## COMMERCIAL TENANT, LONDON\nWe chose our property because the space Abimara had created was designed beautifully and ﬁnished to a very high standard. Once we moved in, we found the Abimara team very helpful, respon-sive to our needs and friendly. As our business has grown so has the ofﬁce we let from Abimara and when we needed to connect two ofﬁces they were open to our ideas and worked hard to help us achieve exactly what we wanted.\n[ View Projects ](https://abimara.com/projects/)\n## Reuben Howard-Mills, Director, Greenfield Estate Agents\nThe team at Abimara are everything a developer should be – friendly, professional and a pleasure to deal with. Highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about development, their attention to detail and level of finish is impeccable. This is clearly demonstrated in all their schemes. Abimara build quality properties which virtually sell themselves.\n[ View Projects ](https://abimara.com/projects/)\n## Commercial tenant, London\nAbimara has been our landlord for five years and we have always found them to be a helpful and easy company to deal with. On the rare occasions we have had to call on Abimara about any issues, they have reacted swiftly to make any repairs necessary to our property. PPR has based itself in two buildings owned and managed by Abimara, both of which have been charming, full of character and, in the case of our current property, brilliantly renovated to suit an office environment.\n[ View Projects ](https://abimara.com/projects/)\n[ ](https://abimara.com/)\n## Useful links\n[Services](https://abimara.com/what-we-do)\n[Projects](https://abimara.com/projects/)\n[About](https://abimara.com/about/)\n[Privacy Policy](https://abimara.com/privacy-policy/)\n## Get in touch\n* [ __ Talk to us ](tel:+44%20\\(0\\)%201903%2088%2099%2066)\n* [ __ info@abimara.com ](mailto:info@abimara.com)\n## Information\nEstablished in 1974, Abimara is a family run business specialising in real estate development and investment.\nCopyright © 2024 Abimara Ltd.

Our commitment to quality of design and construction remains core to our business.\nOur development projects are always design-led to the highest quality standards, creating places that enhance the local environment and spaces in which people can enjoy living and working.\nAs well as outstanding architecture and high quality construction, we place signiﬁcant importance on planting and soft landscaping, which helps enhance the local environment on many levels. Generous planting schemes and green roofs often feature in our projects.\nEnergy efﬁciency and sustainability are also key components, which we achieve through a combination of air source heat pumps, photovoltaic solar panels, high insulation and designing for optimum solar gain.\n### Investment\nOur investment portfolio includes ofﬁces, warehouse, residential and retail properties. We have a proven track record of investing in commercial and residential property; we manage, maintain and optimise these assets whilst working to market conditions for best value.\nOur investment portfolio also beneﬁts from our design and construction expertise so our portfolio includes beautifully designed and constructed workplaces and homes.\n### Project Management & Consultancy\nOur broad range of experience in design, construction, planning, development, and investment means we can offer a comprehensive project management or consultancy service for investors and property owners.\nThis includes but is not limited to:\n* __ Sourcing opportunities\n* __ Feasibility studies\n* __ Gaining planning consents\n* __ Raising debt ﬁnance\n* __ Managing the construction process\n* __ Overall asset management\n* __ Exit strategies\nWe have experience working within conservation areas, national parks, listed buildings, mixed-use buildings, constrained urban sites, and land promotion for larger strategic sites.

Our first projects were on behalf of homeowners and architects specialising in high end, often listed houses. Our sensitivity to design and conservation set us apart from our competitors.\nCommerical\nWe have been investing in and constructing commercial property since the 1990s.

Focusing on aesthetics and textures to suit the required putting surface for an adventure golf course, a choice for three different depths and weaves were chosen to reflect a natural and colourful appeal. Base layers chosen were type 1 mot, path topper 0-5mm dust and 2 layers of membrane.\nWe work within construction safety standards, have a full health and safety folder, have CSCS cards and are CIS Registered.\n#### Second visit to the site\nDuring our second visit we could see more progress and they lay out had started to take shape. Using the plans set out by the architect, we measured the site for the artificial grass, followed the plans to ensure each hole had the correct flow, and got to work.\n#### Starting the process of lining and cutting the artificial turf\nContours and the roll of the ball were considered throughout, whilst making sure the grass is undulated and smooth.\nAll weather glues also ensure we can glue in wet weather, however, we were very pleased to have sunshine throughout the lay process.\n#### Sunny weather ensures good progress\nGreat weather continues throughout the lay process.\nWorking alongside other trades to ensure the deadline was met. We met Gary Orange and his fantastic chainsaw carving expertise.\n#### Progress\nThe course is staring to look like a golf course now. Encompassing three different grades of grass accentuates the undulations and the smoothness of the course.\nWith only a 2 week window, we completed all the greens.\n#### The finished project\nA beautiful high specification course, with challenging areas. Great for all the family. It was a pleasure to work with such a dedicated team and create a wonderful space for people and tourism in Lymington. The course has been designed to enhance peoples knowledge of the The New Forest, and every time we visit we can see new additions added to the course.\n* * *\nCopyright © 2018 New Forest Turf Supplies Ltd - All Rights Reserved.\nPowered by\n[](https://www.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder?isc=pwugc&utm_source=wsb&utm_medium=applications&utm_campaign=en-gb_corp_applications_base)\n#### Cookie Policy\nThis website uses cookies.

Who we share your personal data with** We may provide your personal data to our suppliers and service providers, including other companies in our group, who provide certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data on our behalf. In addition, we may disclose your personal data if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to protect the rights, property, or safety, of our business, our customers or others. This includes, in specific cases, exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection. In some cases, the personal data we collect from you may, for the purposes set out above, be transferred outside United Kingdom and such destinations may not have laws which protect your personal data to the same extent as in the UK.

How long we keep your personal data for** We retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes(s) for which it was provided. What this means in practice will vary between different types of data. When determining the relevant retention periods, we take into account factors including:\n* legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;\n* statute of limitations under applicable law – in the UK this is 6 years for a breach of contract claim, which means we may retain certain data for 6 years following the end of our contract with you or the company you represent;\n* potential or actual disputes – if there is a potential or actual dispute, we will retain the data for a period of time until the dispute is settled; and\n* guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.\nOtherwise, we securely erase your personal data from our systems when it is no longer needed.\n**8\\. Your rights** You have the following rights regarding your personal data:\n**Rights** | **What does this mean?**\n---|---\n1\\. Right of access | You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data (if we are processing it) and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Notice). This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your personal data in accordance with data protection law.\n2\\. Right to rectification | You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n3\\. Right to erasure | This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, it enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.\n4\\. Right to restrict processing | You have the right to ‘block’ or supress further use of your personal data in certain circumstances. When processing is restricted, we can still store your personal data, but may not use it further.\n5\\. Right of data portability | You have the right to obtain your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to request that we port that data to a third party in certain circumstances.\n6\\. Right to object to processing | You have the right to object to us processing your personal data for our legitimate business interests and for direct marketing purposes (including in each case any related profiling). In the former case, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing your data which override your interests, we must stop processing it.\n7\\. Right to withdraw consent to processing | If you have given your consent to us to process your personal data for a particular purpose (for example, direct marketing), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that any processing of your personal data up to that point is unlawful).\n8\\. Right to make a complaint to the data protection authorities | You have the right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal data or believe our processing of your personal data does not comply with data protection law.\n**9\\.

During this time he has carried out both internal and external painting and decoration work for me, both in a personal capacity and for various property owning clients. He is also capable of carrying out repairs to windows and doors, which is extremely useful when dealing with let properties.\nCraig Marles has provided good service over the years and I am confident that our working relationship will continue happily for many years to come.\nCJD Bates BA MRICS - Laws and Fiennes (Land Agent and Chartered Surveyors\nIn my opinion Mr Marles is a competent and professional painter and decorator and he has undertaken a number of contracts for me, both personally and through my business for many clients, over several years. He is capable of a number of styles of decorating and of particular relevancy is his ability to undertake a variety of minor repair works in association with his main business of decorating.\nP.J.Cooper FRICS , Souldern, Oxon\nCraig Marles has worked for me on internal and external decorations for more than 15 years on many different projects involving painting, paper hanging and carpentry repairs etc. He has been entirely reliable, efficient and conscientcious in all aspects of work. He always finishes the project on time and often goes \"The extra mile\", he is a pleasure to have around our home and I would heartily recommend his services.\nP.Cresswell, Tadmarton, Oxon\nMr Marles made a lovely job of painting the exterior of my house, he had to carry out many repairs to the woodwork and replaced a couple of windows which looked very good indeed on completion. He was very helpful in giving me advice on the colour scheme, although the door colours were my own eccentric choice.\nAbove all it was very pleasant to have him around, he was friendly and not at all intrusive. Very highly recommended..\nV.Newey, Chipping Norton, Oxon\n|\n|  |\n---\n|  |\n| Copyright © 2015 C.Marles Ltd All rights reserved. |  | website by [sorbrook](http://www.sorbrook.com?sbkrefprg=1)\n---|---|---"
